 <h2> Movement 1</h2>
 <p>There once was a time in a far away land where
  man and machine were segregated from each other.
  The mechanical revolution caused massive chaos between the two civilizations.
  Machines were tired of only being considered as tools 
  rather than separate beings. So the machines rebelled 
  and separated themselves from humans.
  Divided into two cities , the humans and machines
   lived without each other for decades.
   Forcing humanity to devolve back to the industrial era. 
   This is the story of how that all changed.
   This is Manchanical.
    </p>
 <h2> Movement 2</h2>
 <p> And it all started with some glitches in the system, and his name was _____. 
 Deciding that he would be the person to end
  the separation between man and machine he left his friends and family
   in order to set things right. Arriving at the capital,
    he  was immediately overwhelmed by what he saw in the distance.
     He was not around while man and machine were still together,
      he was astounded by the technological advances that the machines
       had made over the years. Tall, shiny buildings glistening in the sun,
        conveyor belts going form one building to the next. He noticed, 
         that the machines moved in almost perfect synchronization,
          "But how?" he thought , then slowly he began to hear a sound
           getting increasingly louder, it was music, they were moving to the music.
            Getting lost in his thought the beat picked up and the machines began speeding
           toward him in a sudden rush, not knowing where to go he tried to desperately
          tried to speak to the machines hoping that they could help in search for
         others to spread his cause, but none of them listened, being caught in the sudden
        rush of machines he was being pushed and shoved to get out of the way.         
  <h2> Movement 3 </h2>
 <p> Finally after being released from the chaos, he found himself at a park,
    there he came to realization that there will never be peace between the the two worlds.
   As distraught and the feeling of failure flowed through him, he sat himself down on a bench to rest his legs after a long day.
  Then he heard something, almost like movement, he swiftly turned back to check his unpredictable surroundings and saw nothing.
 Rotating back around with some reassurance he looked up and was suddenly greeted by a machine. 
He could not believe what he was seeing with his own eyes.There it was standing right in front of him,
 it looked like one of the original construction bots used before the mechanical revolution. 
  "But why is it not in line like the others?" as he thought this to himself he also realized that bot was rather dented scratched.
   And they did not look like dents made while working on construction, they look the dents a machine would receive if it was hit with objects.
    Very confused and a little disturbed by this and rather sudden introduction, he was left silent as the machine began to speak.
     "Hello, I overheard you talking to yourself and I think I can help you. MY name is _____,and I have a plan.
       Handing him a tattered piece of paper he looked over it, and immediately exclaimed 
        "This is amazing, I never would have thought of this!"  
         But we need to start working now! There is no time to spare! it exclaimed.  
</p>
 <h2>   Movement 4 </h2> 
 <p>   They both quickly sped down to the center of the city to immediately begin building
      what possibly could be the ultimate unifier of the two species.
     Sprinting down the streets of the mute city, he started thinking about how he got here.
    He glanced back for a second and reminded himself of where he had came from.
   He knew there was going back, he knew that the moment he stepped in that city,
  there was no going back. He finally felt like his dream was almost a reality.
 Clenching his fist brimming with fiery passion and embracing this new found ambition,
he jolted forward, leaving the bot in the dust. Now reaching the center of the city,
 without a moment of hesitation, began building with every last bit of energy.
  After countless hours of construction non-stop, the creation was coated with a thin layer
   blood, sweat, and oil. But it was finished, they couldn't believe what they had been able to achieve.
    As the sun turned on, glistening of the metal was quite a sight to see.
     They knew though that when the sun came up- 
      Slowly they began to hear a sound getting increasingly louder, this time he knew exactly what it was.
       And they were prepared, with a flip of a button, they booted up their creation.
        The once tarp that was their creation, awoke. Rising up with a bright blue glow in it's eye.
         It was this New bot that would unify the two nations, almost as a peace offering. The machines, regained full peace with the humans.      </p>
